# RC Car
This RC car that I am building is a big achievment in my life and is something I might want to continue. The things this car can do is range from moving to doing a whole bunch of different things. This is honestly a very cool and exciting project and is something I have wanted to do for a while.

1.(RC Car)[Revalant Name](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53584373674_a0163ce6ac_w.jpg)

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.
