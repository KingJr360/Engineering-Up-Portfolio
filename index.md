# RC Car
This RC car that I am building is a big achievment in my life and is something I might want to continue. The things this car can do is range from moving to doing a whole bunch of different things. This is honestly a very cool and exciting project and is something I have wanted to do for a while.

(Second Arduino Car Milestone)

My second milestone was me being able to apply a controller to the Adruino car that makes it move, then, be able to add a laser to the Adruino car which has been done before but 1 person has done it before me. I am very happy to be able to finally do something I have been wanting to do for so long and lets just say that im pretty good at it.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.
